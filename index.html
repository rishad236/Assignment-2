        <p class="weare">We broke up a month ago</p> 
        <p>Your friends are mine, you know, I know</p> 
        <p>You've moved on, found someone new</p> 
        <p>One more girl who brings out the better in you</p> 

       </div> 


        <div class="second">
            <p>And I thought my heart was detached</p> 
        <p>From all the sunlight of our past</p> 
        <p>But she's so sweet, she's so pretty</p> 
        <p>Does she mean you forgot about me?</p> 

        </div>


        <div class="first">
            <p>Oh, I hope you're happy</p> 
        <p>But not like how you were with me</p> 
        <p>I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go</p> 
        <p>So find someone great, but don't find no one better</p> 
        <p>I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</p>  

        </div>


        <div class="second">
            <p class="weare">And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?</p>
        <p>An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean</p> 
        <p>Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?</p> 
        <p>And now I'm pickin' her apart</p> 
        <p>Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart</p>

            <p>I hope you're happy</p>
        <p>I wish you all the best, really</p> 
        <p>Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me</p> 
        <p>And think of me fondly when your hands are on her</p> 
        <p>I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</p>
